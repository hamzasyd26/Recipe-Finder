# ðŸ¥— Recipe Finder Website
A simple and responsive recipe search app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with TheMealDB API integration.

# ðŸ’¡ About this project
Recipe Finder is a beginner-friendly and useful project where users can search for meals by ingredients or dish names. It allows users to:

Search for recipes using keywords like "chicken" or "pasta"

Fetch a random recipe with one click

View results as recipe cards with images and names

Click on a recipe to view full details in a modal, including ingredients, instructions, category, origin, and video tutorial

Enjoy a smooth and responsive UI with styled components and user feedback for loading/errors

This project helped me strengthen my frontend fundamentals and taught me how to work with public APIs and dynamic DOM rendering.
